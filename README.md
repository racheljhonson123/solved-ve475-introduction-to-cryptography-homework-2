<strong>Ex. 1 –</strong><em> Simple questions</em>

<ol>

 <li>Find the inverse of 17 modulo 101</li>

 <li>Find all the solutions to 12x 28 mod 236.</li>

 <li>Given a plaintext m modulo 31, its corresponding ciphertext is c = m<sup>7</sup> mod 31. Explain how to decrypt the message.</li>

 <li>Factor 4883 and 4369 into a product of primes.<sub>5</sub><sub>)</sub> Find all the primes p such that             mod p is not invertible.7 3</li>

 <li>Let p be a prime and a and b be two integers such that ab 0 mod p. Show that either a or b is congruent to 0 mod p.</li>

 <li>Compute<sup> 2</sup><sup>2017</sup> modulo 5, 13, and 31. What is<sup> 2</sup><sup>2017</sup> mod 2015 <strong> 2 –</strong><em> Rabin ciyptosystem</em></li>

 <li>Research and explain how the Rabin cryptosystem works.</li>

 <li>To implement decryption for the Rabin cryptosystem on decides to build a machine that does the When the device is given a number x, it computes the square root of x mod n. Since there usually are more than one, it chooses one at random. If one get a meaningful message he assumes this is the correct result and otherwise input x again.</li>

 <li>Explain why a meaningful message can be expected fairly soon</li>

 <li>If Eve intercepts x, can she easily determine the original message?</li>

 <li>Eve has stolen the device and plans to run some attacks on it. What type of attack should she run to recover the factorization of n. Explain the process.</li>

</ol>

<em>Note:</em> the computation of square roots mod n will be covered later, so there is no need to detail this part.

<strong>Ex. 3 –</strong><em> CRT</em>

A group prepares for a parade. If they arrange in rows of three, one person is left over. If they line up four to a row, two are left over and if they try rows of five, three are left over. What are the two smallest possible number of people in the group?
